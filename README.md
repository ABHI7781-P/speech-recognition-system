#DESCRIPTION

This project demonstrates a Voice-Controlled Device Automation System that utilizes speech recognition technology integrated with an embedded control board to operate electrical devices such as lights and fans through spoken commands. The system offers a modern, touchless interface to control household or industrial appliances, particularly useful in home automation, assistive technologies, and smart environment development.

The core concept revolves around recognizing a user’s voice input through a browser-based application, interpreting the command, and transmitting it to an embedded controller such as an Arduino, ESP32, or Raspberry Pi. The embedded board then processes the command and actuates connected devices accordingly. This seamless interaction between software and hardware offers a hands-free, intuitive, and accessible method for controlling physical systems.

Working Principle
The user initiates voice recognition by clicking a “Start Listening” button on the web interface.

The speech recognition engine converts spoken words to text and processes it.

If a valid command is detected (e.g., “Turn on the light”), the text is parsed, and an appropriate signal or message is sent to the embedded board.

The embedded system interprets the command and controls output devices using GPIO pins, typically via relay drivers for AC appliances.

Feedback is displayed to the user in the browser or through LED indicators or an LCD on the hardware side.

Applications
Smart Homes: Enable remote or local voice-controlled automation for lighting, fans, HVAC, or smart plugs.

Assistive Technologies: Beneficial for individuals with mobility limitations to control their environment.

Industrial Automation: Control machinery or systems through voice without physical interaction.

IoT Prototypes: Useful in developing scalable IoT applications using voice as a control interface.
